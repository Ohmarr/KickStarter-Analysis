# Unit 1 | Assignment - KickStart My Chart

of over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Instructions

* Create two new columns, one called `category` at Q and another called `sub-category` at R, which *********************************************** Do we have to use formulas? or can we use Text to Column function?
use formulas to split the `Category and Sub-Category` column into two parts.

************************************************** Is 'DS' deadline?
  * Create a new column named `Date Created Conversion` that will use [this formula](http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/converting_unix_timestamps/) to convert the data contained within `DS` into Excel's Date format

  * Create a new column named `Date Ended Conversion` that will use [this formula](http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/converting_unix_timestamps/) to convert the data contained within `deadline` into Excel's Date format

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of `state`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the count of `state`, and filters based on `parent category` and `Years`.

  * Now create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.

* Create a report in Microsoft Word and answer the following questions...

1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
2. What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?

## Bonus

* Create a new sheet with 8 columns: `Goal`, `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, `Number Canceled`, `Total Projects`, `Percentage Successful`, `Percentage Failed`, and `Percentage Canceled`

  * In the `goal` column, create twelve rows with the following headers...

    * Less Than 1000
    * 1000 to 4999
    * 5000 to 9999
    * 10000 to 14999
    * 15000 to 19999
    * 20000 to 24999
    * 25000 to 29999
    * 30000 to 34999
    * 35000 to 39999
    * 40000 to 44999
    * 45000 to 49999
    * Greater than or equal to 50000

    ![Goal Outcomes](Images/GoalOutcomes.PNG)

  * Using the `COUNTIFS()` formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within those ranges listed above. Populate the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns with this data.

  * Add up each of the values in the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns to populate the `Total Projects` column. Then, using a mathematic formulae, find the percentage of projects which were successful, failed, or were canceled per goal range.

  * Create a line chart which graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

* To submit, please upload to Github repo and submit the link to repo to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
